# MiniHack
Project for MiniHack Hackathon at the University of Reading on the 25th of January 2017. Got us 2nd place! Checks for tweets directed at it with another users username in it and then uses that accounts past tweet data to generate new tweets using a Markov Chain. Looks for a config file named "test.cfg" in the root directory for twitter API keys (check samplecfg for the formatting)
