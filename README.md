# MiniHack
Project for MiniHack Hackathon at the University of Reading on the 25th of January 2017. Got us 2nd place!

Created by James McCartney ([@jsmuk](https://github.com/jsmuk)), Lucy Firman ([@mikotohe2](https://github.com/mikotohe2)) and Jamie Luckett ([@jimjam707](https://github.com/JimJam707))

Looks for a config file named "test.cfg" in the root directory for twitter API keys (check samplecfg for the formatting)
